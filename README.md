# Fan-Control
Controls by temerature the speed of a fan driven by PWM

This small project is intended for cooling situations where the focus is on maximum noise reduction. To achieve this goal, the temperature is measured with a sensor and processed by a microcontroller. This ÂµC generates a pulse width modulated signal with 32kHz for a fan. The duty cycle of this PWM is directly proportional to the measured temperature.

Only a few parts are needed. The software can be realized with the Arduino IDE. We use here an Atmel ATtiny85, but other types with at least one analog input and a PWM capable output are also suitable.
The program is small enough to work on narrow-breasted microcontrollers. Only an internal clock frequency of 8MHz is necessary to output the PWM signal at 32Mhz.

The 32Khz are necessary because some fans tend to produce an unsightly whistle at low frequencies.
